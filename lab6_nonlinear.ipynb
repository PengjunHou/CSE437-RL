        "The agent controls a lander that starts at the top of the screen and must safely land on the landing pad between two flags.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **State space**: Continuous vector of 8 variables, including:\n",
        "  - Position (x, y)\n",
        "  - Velocity (x_dot, y_dot)\n",
        "  - Angle and angular velocity\n",

        "  - -100 for crashing\n",
        "  - Small negative reward for firing engines (fuel cost)\n",
        "  - Episode ends when lander crashes or comes to rest\n",

        "   - Neural network that approximates Q(s, a).\n",
        "   - Input: state vector (8 floats).\n",
        "   - Output: Q-values for 4 actions.\n",
        "   - Suggested architecture: 2 hidden layers with 128 neurons each, ReLU activation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Target Network**\n",
        "   - A copy of the Q-network that is updated less frequently (e.g., every 1000 steps).\n",
        "   - Used for stable target computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Replay Buffer**\n",
        "   - Stores transitions `(s, a, r, s_next, done)`.\n",
        "   - Sample random mini-batches to break correlation between consecutive samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **ε-Greedy Policy**\n",
        "   - With probability ε, take a random action.\n",
        "   - Otherwise, take `argmax_a Q(s, a)`.\n",
        "   - Decay ε over time (e.g., from 1.0 → 0.05).\n",
